Changes
=======

Several new kernels are available. These include several type conversions, some
fixed point complex operations, and a complex float divide.

Volk_config functions are now overloaded to be able to read and write to a
custom volk_config path which can be controlled with a new `--path` option in
volk_profile.

Volk-config-info can now tell you the alignment VOLK is using for your CPU and
malloc implementation used in volk_profile.

Builds define the Dual ABI macro `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI` to 1, which should
allow builds with GCC 4 when linking against C++ libraries that are built with
GCC 5.
