summary: VOLK release v3.3.0

Hi everyone!

This is the VOLK v3.3.0 release! We want to thank all contributors.
This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

We received a lot of improvements to existing kernels, new kernels,
and optimized support for a lot of existing kernels.
Moreover, a lot more implementations make use of AVX512 now, as well as
more optimizations for RiscV, and more NEON implementations.
Thus, overall this is a very exciting release!

Additionally, we received updates all over the code base to improve code quality.
Obsolete code was removed, we get closer and closer to being able to remove the
cpu_features submodule and rely on the distribution package everywhere.
Besides, our throughput test output received a face lift to make it easier to digest.

Finally, over the years, we discussed in-place kernel operations repeatedly.
While we don't test correct in-place operation, e.g., GNU Radio relies on it for
multiple kernels. Finding a way to check and document this behavior is an ongoing effort.
