# Copyright Assignment

VOLK is a sub-project of GNU Radio. As such copyright is owned by the Free
Software Foundation. Before VOLK accepts significant (>10 lines) changes from
an individual we need a copyright assignment. See (Why the FSF gets copyright
assignment from contributors)[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html] for
the rationale. To start the process contact Tom Rondeau or Nathan West.

# Working on VOLK

## Git workflow

The official git code is tracked on two branches with git. The `maint` branch
is where bug fixes belong. The `master` branch is where everything else goes.

Checkout the branch appropriate for your change and start a new branch with a
short name describing your feature. The branch name should be meaningful in the
git log if it appears in a merge commit.

The first line of every commit message should be less than 70 characters with
the following format

    component name: brief summary that is less than 70 characters

If more detail is needed, skip a line and add more detail. Keep lines to less
than 80 characters.

## Submitting Your Changes

The preferred method of submitting changes is through a Github Pull Request to
https://github.com/gnuradio/volk. For smaller changes you can upload a
patchfile generated by git to the issue tracker.

If you have substantial changes and prefer to not use Github then send a note
on IRC or the mailing list describing your changes and a link to a publically
available git repository.

All pull requests and patch series will be tested by running ctest on x86_64
(64-bit), x86 (32-bit), and armv7hf architectures.
