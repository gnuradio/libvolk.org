# Matrix

VOLK is part of the GNU Radio ecosystem. Therefore, we use Matrix as our primary chat system nowadays.
Find us on [chat.gnuradio.org](https://chat.gnuradio.org/). Of course, most discussions will be on #gnuradio:gnuradio.org.
Though, we have our own room #volk:gnuradio.org as well.


# Mailing List

There is currently no mailing list dedicated to VOLK. For now either use IRC or
the [GNU Radio mailing list](http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/MailingLists)
and use the predicate \[VOLK\] in  your subject line.
